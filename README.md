# webSocketDotNET
Simple webSocket application in ASP.NET MVC. This will give a basic code example on how to integrate webSocket with ASP.NET MVC. I used raw javascript for webSocket API, although you can use frameworks like Socket.io. On the server-side, install a nuget package : Microsoft.WebSockets. This demo project has been built with Visual Studio 2015
